I work across any genre, taking sometimes complex content and synthesizing into easily understood, and well-structured layouts. I have experience leading teams from major federal organizations to small private sector clients and can take on any project, big or small. I can lead, or jump in and help execute on deliverables. </p>
				<p>I work through interviews with stakeholders to assess and develop system and business requirements that help ensure the right system or tools are built and implemented for both internal and external users. I also work to discover financial and time restrictions that may affect the scope and budget for major development projects to ensure the right balance is found for time, scope, budget, and acceptable risk levels.

					<p class="animate-this" data-animate="fadeInLeft">As the project manager and designer for a new White House innovation toolkit in support of GSA's Challenge.gov program, I worked to synthesize mounds of content into a usable training resource for innovators in the federal government. I led a 7-month kickoff team of three people, coordinated usability tests, drew up site concepts, and designed the brand presence. I interviewed managers and community to decompose stories into useful requirements and personas that acutely aligned to core users. Drafted user research reports to brief the team on needs and goals. Presented to applicable White House staff. Created all brand graphics and site design. Kept team on schedule and developed broad goals and requirements based on $0 budget and limited staff. 
				
					</br></br>
					
					With an expanded 15-member team, I led content strategy and design refinements and worked with accessibility specialists to refine the brand and UX guide.

					<p class="animate-this" data-animate="fadeInRight">Debt collection is a sensitive topic, but people have rights when it comes to how they are treated when facing financial hardships. In order to raise awareness of the resources available to people at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I worked with various UX leads, media specialists, and developers to create and reorganize the suite of consumer videos, create the first model for money topic resources in the Consumer Experience Information Architecture project lead, and worked with video specialists to produce four new consumer interview stories. <br><br>

					I also worked with Bureau stakeholders to incorporate data from the CFPB research report: Consumer Experiences With Debt Collection into the story pages, as well as related action steps, and a call to readers to share their experience. This combination of data, resources, and personal stories better communicates the broader example of how this affects people from all walks of life. 
					<br><br>
					I was given the opportunity to interview Bernadette first-hand and experience the raw emotion as I heard her story and responses to the interview. Her bravery in telling her story, and everyone else who shares their story, helps prove how the work everyone does in financial empowerment is so very important.

							  	<p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure of working with Kristin at the CPSC around 2013 - 2015. She was the agency's lead for social media outreach and engagement. Kristin was extremely knowledgeable in different social media platforms, web content development, and user experience design. But what struck me the most was her attitude. "Can-do attitude" is an often-used label but Kristin is truly the epitome of being confident and resilient in the face of tough challenges. Kristin was the driving force behind the efforts to modernize the agency's legacy web content management system which will lead to better user experience, improved content quality, and lower maintenance costs. Any organization would be fortunate to have her!&rdquo;</p>

								<p>&ldquo;Kristin has proven herself to be a critical thinker that delves below the surface to gain a deeper understanding of the issues and provide creative and thoughtful solutions. </br></br>Her work is polished and professional and knows how to convey ideas and recommendations to senior managers and executives. She is detailed oriented and plays very well in a team environment.&rdquo;</p>

								<p>&ldquo;I'm the outgoing executive officer to the Commander of NORAD and USNORTHCOM and I won't rehash her glowing record of performance. I'll simply say...hire her! She ran my marketing office at Aviano Air Base, Italy and was integral in our unit winning best in the Air Force back to back years! One of the best hires during my entire command tour... she's that good!</br> </br></br>
								Smart, savvy, driven, energetic, personable, loyal, trustworthy...Kristin is the complete package. She's also a tremendous wife, mom, and member of the community, and has my strongest possible endorsement. Just wanted you to know she is even better in person than she is on paper and she'd be a tremendous addition to your team!&rdquo;</p>

								<p>&ldquo;I have been Ms. Dohnâ€™s direct supervisor for almost two years and by any measure, she is one of the most gifted, driven and capable young professionals I have encountered in my career as a federal civil servant.
								</br></br>
								Ms. Dohn is a can-do practitioner with a self-starter attitudeâ€”invaluable attributes for any creative professional.
								</br></br>
								Beyond the intellectual curiosity that fuels her drive to explore the opportunities within each creative challenge, she actively seeks out and welcomes constructive criticism. Perhaps most important of all, Ms. Dohn is a resourceful systems thinker who can deliver on her vision. She is comfortable with the tools of the trade and can confidently apply her many talents to solve real-world creative challenges.
								</br></br>
								Ms. Dohn routinely exceeds my towering expectations, is exceptionally talented, and her contributions would benefit any organization.&rdquo;</p>
